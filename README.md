# single-price-grid-challenge

This design was from frontendmentor.io [https://www.frontendmentor.io]. I used this to practice different ways of styling pages. I've practiced CSS Flex-box, CSS Grid, Mobile-first work flow and many other good CSS practices.

This can be used a template to work on. You would like to change any of the code; you are very welcome to do so.
